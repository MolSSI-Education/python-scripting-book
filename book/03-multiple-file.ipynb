    "In our previous lesson, we parsed values from output files. \n",
    "While you might have seen the utility of doing such a thing, you might have also wondered why we didn’t just search the file and cut and paste the values we wanted into a spreadsheet. \n",
    "If you only have 1 or 2 files, this might be a very reasonable thing to do. \n",
    "But what if you had 100 files to analyze? \n",
    "What if you had 1000? \n",
    "In such a case the cutting and pasting method would be very tedious and time consuming.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the real powers of writing a program to analyze your data is that you can just as easily analyze 100 files as 1 file. In this example, we are going to parse the output files for a whole series of aliphatic alcohol compounds and parse the energy value for each one. The output files are all saved in a folder called outfiles that you should have downloaded in the setup for this lesson. Make sure the folder is in the same directory as the directory where you are writing and executing your code.\n",

    "In this lesson, we will be using the `glob` library, which will help us read in multiple files from our computer. "
