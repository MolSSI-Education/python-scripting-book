    "\n",
    "Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How do I use NumPy arrays?\n",
    "\n",
    "Objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use functions in `numpy` to read in tabular data from comma separated value files.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Access information in a numpy array using column names and row numbers.\n",

    "* Learn about array axes.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy, short for Numerical Python, is a powerful library that provides support for working with large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these data structures. It is widely used in scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning for tasks that require numerical computations on large data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module we will focus on reading in and analyzing numerical data, visualizing the data, and working with arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reading text from files\n",
    "\n",
    "As we already discussed, there are many ways to read in data from files in Python. \n",
    "In our last module, we used the readlines() function to read in a complex output file. \n",
    "In theory, you could always use the readlines() function, and then use the data parsing tools we learned in the previous module to format the data as you needed. \n",
    "But sometimes there are other ways that make more sense, particularly if the data is formatted in a table. \n",
    "\n",
    "A common table format is the `CSV` file or `comma separated values`.\n",
    "This is exactly what it sounds like. \n",
    "Data is presented in rows, with each value separated by a comma. \n",
    "If you have data in a spreadsheet program that you need to import into a python code, you can save the data as a csvfile to read it in.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we are going to read in the data using a library called NumPy.\n",
    "NumPy has a data type called an `array`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we have a CSV file that contains data from analysis of a molecular dynamics trajectory. \n",
    "We have a 20 ns simulation that used a 2 fs timestep. \n",
    "The data was saved to the trajectory file every 1000 steps, so our file has 10,000 timesteps. \n",
    "At each timestep, we are interested in the distance between particular atoms. \n",
    "These trajectories were generated with the AMBER molecular dynamics program and the distances were measured with the Python program MDAnalysis. \n",
    "The table of atomic distances was saved as a CSV file called “distance_data_headers.csv”. \n",
    "This file was downloaded as part of your lesson materials. \n",
    "Open the file in a text editor and study it to determine its structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "In analyzing tabular data, we often need to perform the same types of calculations (averaging, calculating the minimum or maximum of the data set), so we are once again going to use a Python library, this time a library that contains lots of functions to work with numerical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we will do is import the NumPy library. When NumPy is imported, it is often shortened to `np`"
