    "You will need to access the JupyterLab or Jupyter notebook. \n",
    "You may either install Python and the Jupyter notebook on your computer, or access a Python environment in your browser. \n",
    "If you are new to Python programming, we recommend trying it out in your browser on a platform such as chemcompute for this workshop.\n",
