    "One of the most common tasks in research is analyzing data.\n",
    "Many computational chemistry programs output text files that include a large amount of information including text and data that you need to analyze. Often, you need to sort through the output file and identify particular pieces of information that are most important to you. \n",

    "\n",
    "For this section, we will be working with the file `ethanol.out` in the `outfiles` directory.\n",

    "If you have a file with lots of different types of information, text and numbers, with different types of formatting, the most generic way to read in information is the `read` or `readlines` function. \n",
    "Before you can read in a file, you have to open the file using the file path we defined above. \n",
    "This will create a file object, or filehandle. The file we will be analyzing in this example is a PSI4 output file for a SCF/cc-pVDZ energy calculation for an ethanol molecule.\n",
