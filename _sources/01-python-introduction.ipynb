    "\n",
    "All of the software you use on a regular basis is created through the use of programming languages. \n",
    "Programming languages allow us to write instructions to a computer. \n",
    "There are many different programming languages, each with their own strengths, weaknesses, and uses. \n",
    "Some popular programming languages you might hear about are Javascript (used on the web - any website with interactive content likely uses javascript), Python (scientific programming and many other applications), C++ (high performance applications - much of computational chemistry, self-driving cars, etc), SQL (databases), and many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a computer programming language that has become ubiquitous in scientific programming. \n",
    "The Python programming language was first introduced in the year 1991, and has grown to be one of the most popular programming languages for both scientists and non-scientists. \n",
    "According to the [2022 Stack Overflow Developer Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#most-popular-technologies-language-prof), Python is the fourth most popular programming language.\n",
    "Compared to other programming languages, Python is considered more intutitive to start learning and is also extremely versatile. \n",
    "Python can be used to build web applications, interact with databases, and calculate and analyze data.\n",
    "Python also has many libraries focused on science and machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In computational chemistry, we will see that we can use Python to run and analyze our simulations. \n",
    "We can also use some of Python's many libraries to fit data and predict properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "Our initial lessons will run python interactively through a Python interpreter. \n",
    "We will use an environment called a Jupyter notebook. \n",
    "The Jupyter notebook is an environment in your browser that can be used to write an execute Python code interactively.\n",
    "The setup page should have provided information on how to access a Jupyter notebook. \n",
    "Everything included in a code block is something you could type into your python interpreter and evaluate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting up your Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "In the setup, you learned how to start a Jupyter notebook. \n",
    "Now, we will use the notebook to execute Python code. \n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are divided into cells. \n",
    "You run a Jupyter notebook one cell at a time. \n",
    "To execute a cell, click inside the cell and press shift+enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the upper left corner, click where it says “Untitled” and change the name to “MolSSI Workshop”. We have now changed the name of the Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks allow us to also use something called markdown in some cells.\n",
    "We can use markdown to write descriptions about our notebooks for others to read. \n",
    "It’s a good practice to have your first cell be markdown to explain the purpose of the notebook. Let’s do that in our first cell. \n",
    "Click inside the first cell, then on the top of the screen select Cell->Cell Type->Markdown (shown below).\n",
    "\n",

    "In Markdown, we create headers using a single # sign. Using two (##) creates a subheader. After typing this into a cell, press `shift+enter` to evaluate. Now your notebook should look like the following.\n",
